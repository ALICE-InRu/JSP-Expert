\subsection{Resampling} \label{sec:sampling} 
\todo[inline,caption={}]{This is still missing. Sampling strategies that have 
	been applied (but not fully summarised)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item equal probability (current setting)
		\item w.r.t. best and worst case scenario
		\item inverted stepwise optimality
		\item or simply double emphasis on first half vs. second half (and vice 
		      versa)
	\end{itemize}}
